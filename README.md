A collection of libraries used in my thesis work.
These include:

FileIOLibrary - a collection of files for importing 3d object files

FiniteElementLibrary - a collection of files for computing the stiffness and mass matrices for different geometries

GeometryLibrary - a collection of files for describing an object's physical properties

MathLibrary - a collection of files for performing common linear algebra computations

ResonatorLibrary - a collection of files for computing resonator properties 

ViewLibrary - a collection of files for viewing 3d models and changing their properties for simulation

===============

Drivers for these libraries are forthcoming.
